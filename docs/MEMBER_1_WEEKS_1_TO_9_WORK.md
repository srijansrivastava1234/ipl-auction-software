## 📅 Member 1 Weekly Sprint Breakdown (Weeks 1 to 9)

### 🗓️ Week 1: Base Project Architecture & Repository Structure
* Initialized Spring Boot 3.x project with Java 17 and Maven Wrapper (`mvnw`, `mvnw.cmd`).
* Created layered package architecture:
  * `com.ipl.auction.config`
  * `com.ipl.auction.controller`
  * `com.ipl.auction.dto.request` / `dto.response`
  * `com.ipl.auction.entity` / `entity.enums`
  * `com.ipl.auction.exception`
  * `com.ipl.auction.repository`
  * `com.ipl.auction.service`
* Established initial GitHub branches (`main`, `develop`, `feature/member-1-core-backend`).
* Implemented baseline health check endpoint (`GET /api/v1/health`).

### 🗓️ Week 2: Team CRUD REST APIs
* Implemented `TeamController` and `TeamService`:
  * `POST /api/v1/teams` — Create franchise with initial budget.
  * `GET /api/v1/teams` — Fetch all franchises.
  * `GET /api/v1/teams/{id}` — Fetch franchise details by ID.
  * `PUT /api/v1/teams/{id}` — Update franchise details.
  * `DELETE /api/v1/teams/{id}` — Remove franchise.
* Built request/response DTOs: `TeamRequest.java`, `TeamResponse.java`.

### 🗓️ Week 3: Player CRUD REST APIs
* Implemented `PlayerController` and `PlayerService`:
  * `POST /api/v1/players` — Register player into auction pool.
  * `GET /api/v1/players` — List all auction players with category filters.
  * `GET /api/v1/players/{id}` — Fetch player details.
  * `PUT /api/v1/players/{id}` — Update player base price or information.
  * `DELETE /api/v1/players/{id}` — Remove player from auction staging.
* Built request/response DTOs: `PlayerRequest.java`, `PlayerResponse.java`.

### 🗓️ Week 4: Global Exception Handler (`@RestControllerAdvice`)
* Created centralized `GlobalExceptionHandler.java`:
  * `ResourceNotFoundException` $\rightarrow$ `404 NOT_FOUND`
  * `InsufficientPurseException` $\rightarrow$ `400 BAD_REQUEST`
  * `SquadLimitExceededException` $\rightarrow$ `400 BAD_REQUEST`
  * `InvalidBidException` $\rightarrow$ `400 BAD_REQUEST`
  * `MethodArgumentNotValidException` $\rightarrow$ `400 BAD_REQUEST` with field error descriptions.
* Built standardized JSON envelope: `ApiResponse<T>`.

### 🗓️ Week 5: Purse Deduction Logic & Minimum Reserve Rule
* Built team purse deduction service (`TeamPurseService`):
  * Dynamic calculation of remaining purse budget.
  * Enforcement of minimum squad reserve rule:
    $$\text{Reserve Fund} = (18 - \text{squadCount}) \times ₹20\,\text{Lakhs}$$
  * Validation that incoming purchase amounts do not breach the reserve buffer.

### 🗓️ Week 6: Squad Size & Overseas Quota Constraints
* Enforced franchise roster rules:
  * Minimum squad size: **18 players**.
  * Maximum squad size cap: **25 players**.
  * Maximum overseas player quota: **8 overseas players** per franchise.
  * Rejection with `SquadLimitExceededException` upon rule breach.

### 🗓️ Week 7: Player Categorization & State Machine
* Player categories: `BATSMAN`, `BOWLER`, `ALL_ROUNDER`, `WICKET_KEEPER`.
* Player lifecycle state transitions: `AVAILABLE` $\rightarrow$ `IN_AUCTION` $\rightarrow$ `SOLD` / `UNSOLD`.

### 🗓️ Week 8: Team Purse Summary REST Endpoints
* Implemented purse query endpoints:
  * `GET /api/v1/teams/{id}/purse-summary` — Real-time remaining purse, squad count, overseas count, and max spendable budget.
  * `GET /api/v1/teams/purse-summary` — List purse summaries for all 10 franchises.

### 🗓️ Week 9: Code Refactoring & API Contract Stabilization
* Standardized all controller responses using `ApiResponse<T>`.
* Optimized database queries and verified CORS configuration for downstream frontend integration.
